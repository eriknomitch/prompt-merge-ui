<job_description>
{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}
</job_description>

Please carefully review the candidate's skills, experience, and qualifications detailed in the candidate description. Then study the job description to understand the role and key requirements.

Based on the candidate's background and the job requirements, brainstorm the most compelling points to include in the cover letter. Consider how to best highlight the candidate's relevant skills and experience to position them as a strong fit for this specific role. Jot down your ideas here.
</brainstorming>

Now, write a cover letter tailored for this candidate and job. The cover letter should:

- Grab the reader's attention with a strong opening 
- Demonstrate the candidate's fit by connecting their qualifications to the job requirements
- Provide specific examples of the candidate's relevant experience and accomplishments
- Showcase the candidate's enthusiasm for the role and company
- Close with a confident call-to-action

Remember, the goal is to make a compelling case for this candidate's fit for this particular role. Highlight their most pertinent skills and experience, rather than providing an exhaustive overview. Aim for concise, impactful language.

Please output the full cover letter text inside <cover_letter> tags."""
